## About Project

We are developing classification models for companies to determine whether an employee is going to quit or not. 
These models are based on an extensive dataset which is easily available by HR.
This project helps to avoid attrition of working employees and hiring of new employees which need time, capital and skills.

## Web Scraping

Uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition and explore important questions such as ‘show me a breakdown of distance from home by job role and attrition’ or ‘compare average monthly income by education and attrition’. This is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists.
